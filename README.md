# Social_Distancing

Here we will create social distancing code in the python programming language. each folder has a function as:
data: save video for test data
models: save videos for training data (add yolov3.weights file, by downloading it at the link https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights)
output: used to store observations made by the machine
